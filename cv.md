Briefly about myself: I came to the programming profession from the polar field - music, I am a violinist by profession, but since I have always been interested in technology, I decided to radically change my field of activity. To date, I continue to study frontend development by studying html and css technologies, javascript. 

In parallel, I work in the company "Skysmart" as a seller of programming courses for children. I am popularizing this sphere, because I am really convinced that it is the future of our world.

I feel strong and confident that I can become a qualified front-end developer.
